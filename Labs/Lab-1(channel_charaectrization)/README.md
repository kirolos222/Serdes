this a method to charaectrize a channel but to get the needed S21 from diffrential equation we need to derive it , it was derived from this link https://www.signalintegrityjournal.com/articles/1832-a-guide-for-singleended-to-mixedmode-s-parameter-
conversions

channel S21 ==> to show the effect of losses like skin losses and dieletric losses :

remember that skin losses is direct proportional to sqrt(freq) and dieletric losses is direct proportional to freq

why is the phase shift is a ramp signal for S21 ??
